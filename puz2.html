    <p>You must bring a cat, mouse, and block of cheese with you across the river. You boat is only bouyant enough to hold you and one other item. If the cat and mouse are alone, the cat eats the mouse, if the mouse and cheese are alone, the mouse eats the cheese. How many crossings (going to or from) will it take to get everything across?</p>
